-----------------------------------
Finish build-3  (end of January, late)
-----------------------------------

Finish ACS biasfile handling:  matching errors,  special case code minimization & cleanup,  file submission correctness
Review disposition of implicitly cancelled files when a lock is lost
Set up CRDS background agent to monitor server aliveness and stale submitted files

---------------------------
Finish build-4 end of April
---------------------------

1. Dataset Best References  (multiple datasets input,  multiple datasets display, fix db query errors / association handling)
2. Database generalization and cleanup
3. Finalize and document command line utilities

Set up "continuous integration" for CRDS/CDBS reference file submissions.  

    1. Manually update baseline rules with new files.  Todd starts parallel ops with CDBS file submissions
    2. Automatically test all datasets against website contexts weekly or nightly,  resolve differences

#56       DMS-535 Files must be archived before use                                                  done, needs testing and activation / configuration
#148     DMS-540, DMS-541 web dataset best references                                         major work required,  multiple datasets,  catalog db generalization and debug
#149     DMS-545 best refs multiple contexts, crds.file_bestrefs                               mostly done,  needs sign-off day
#150     DMS-547, mapping browse capability                                                          mostly done,  could use syntax coloring
#151     DMS-548, list references for observing modes                                             not started,  modest work, 2 days to a week
#152     DMS-HST-1, crds.certify reversion checking                                                 done
#153     DMS-HST-2, crds.sync tool                                                                          mostly done,  needs sign off day,  can be improved for JWST scale files
#154     DMS-HST-4, crds.certify/crds.diff context-to-context mode coverage         1-2 days for basic coverage,  possibly more for tabular modes
#155     DMS-HST-13, crds.certify detect different parkeys                                       basic couple hours,   header differencing 1-2 days
#156     DMS-680, crds.certify validate input files                                                     huge umbrella requirement,  operational for HST,  little for JWST, "never done"

#4         Implement web server dataset catalog access for best references                 Aspect of DMS-540, 1-5 days, handle associations, catalog header bugs,  multiple data set support
#5         Handle multiple datasets for best references                                                Aspect of DMS-540, input form for multiple upload modes,  tabular output display,  2x overall effort,  1-2 weeks
#46       Implement CRDS background agent                                                             2-4 days, monitor server and e-mail,  scan for stale submissions,  compute sha1sums in background,  copy user owned files,  run/stop setup

Remaining TODO-style tickets,  I regard these all as self-imposed "would be nice" requirements:

#17     Address browser restrictions  
#30     Generalize catalog database code for use by JWST and "recalibration" utilities   
#38     Web form best refererences text file, e-mail

#81     Side-by-side testing with CDBS issues
#90     Implement server database backup scheme
#91     Review data_file and utils hacks and add unit tests
#111     checking column values in certify should not use PyFITS directly
#114     Identify and prevent submission of identical files    
#117     Diff tool should also work in the data
#118     Create contexts / submit mappings
#120     crds.certify tables warning too much
#121     Add auto-logout    
#123     Restrict file upload dialog to one copy of any file
#124     Enhance best references web views for multiple datasets, input and results
#126     Add tests cases for best references display extra modes    
#127     The Rmap Logical diffs should provide more information
#130     Explore Best References should have * as an option  
#132     Add aperture to Browse Database results page  
#134     Switch blob encoding to JSON
#138     Enable .imap based best references
#140     CRDS blacklisting resolutions
#141     differencing improvements
#31     Consolidate HST configuration files
#72     explore best ref web page: confusing inputs and usage    
#74     certify should allow for some on-the-fly corrections
#68     dataset best references web page: indicate differences in results
#69     dataset best references web page: expanded help could be useful

#143     DMS-HST-18, reference file selection info files                                                                   undefined, not started
#144     DMS-HST-19, context-to-context affected instruments and modes                                   poorly defined, not started,  not super hard once defined depending on "modes"
#159     DMS-543, ability to mark reference files bad                                                                      mostly done,  want sync tool to note blacklisted files

#163     DMS-HST-7, operational context display                                                                            not started,  costly in interface time with undefined sites

#104     Implement scheme for large file submissions                                                                     Supporting large files probably requires background processing and modified work flow,  Large file upload system bugs
#119     CRDS security review                                                                                                          2-4 days, plus interaction with ITSD

#168     Add SSL support, enable offsite authenticated use                                                              Self-imposed,  unknown impact,  guessing 2 days
