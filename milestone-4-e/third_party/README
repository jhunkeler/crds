Critical/enhanced portions of django-json-rpc are built into
the CRDS client and don't need to be installed separately.
See crds.client.proxy

Parsley is used by crds.certify to check for duplicate entries in
mappings.  Checking is optional and fails nicely if parsely is not
installed...  but thanks to third_party it always should be.
