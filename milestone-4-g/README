Installation for someone with csh access should be simple:

% ./install

will install the CRDS library and HST rmaps to your Python stack at
the default location in site-packages.  People without csh access
should read the install script and improvise.   Any additional parameters
passed into ./install will be supplied to all of the nested 
invocations of "python setup.py install" for the various CRDS packages.

Basic checkout of the CRDS client/library can be accomplished by:

% ./runtests
