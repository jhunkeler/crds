The Atlas9 Stellar Atmosphere Models by Castelli and Kurucz 2004
................................................................

This atlas contains about 4300 stellar atmosphere models for a wide
range of metallicities, effective temperatures and gravities.  These
LTE models with no convective overshooting computed by Fiorella
Castelli, have improved upon the opacities and abundances previously used
by Kurucz (1990). The main improvements, as detailed in Castelli and
Kurucz (2003), are the use of improved solar abundances and TiO lines.

For more information, see the `relevant section <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/astronomical_catalogs.html#castelli-kurucz>`_ of the CDBS webpage on `astronomical catalogs <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/astronomical_catalogs.html>`_, and the `README <http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/cdbs/grid/ck04models/AA_README>`_ file for this catalog.
