STIS Filters and Dispersers

Note that MAMA imaging observations are subject to especially strict |BOL|_ , and
will not be performed unless ALL objects in or near the aperture can be shown to
be below these limits.

As STIS filters are located in the STIS slit wheel they must be listed as apertures
in  `Phase II proposals <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/proposing/phase2>`_  and cannot be used in combination
with other  `apertures <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/design/apertures/>`_ . The STIS filters can, however, be used
together with a  `grating <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/design/gratings/>`_  to do filtered
`slitless first order spectroscopy <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c12_special2.html#308908>`_ . 
This can be especially useful when it is necessary to exclude contamination due to geocoronal lines.

STIS has a relatively limited set of filters. However its
`imaging capabilities <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c05_imaging2.html#324179>`_ 
do include some unique advantages that make it worth considering as an
alternative to WFPC2 or ACS for some
`UV <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c05_imaging4.html#354124>`_  and
`optical <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c05_imaging3.html#314889>`_  imaging projects.
