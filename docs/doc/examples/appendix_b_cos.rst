**Choosing a Grating/Central Wavelength**

The grating you choose is the main optical element that determines
the spectral resolution of your observations. The tables linked below
give the details of the various COS gratings, the corresponding
wavelength coverage, spectral resolution, etc.

COS Dark current
----------------

In Cycle 18, a COS FUV dark rate of 2.25e-6 counts/s/pixel was reported in the
IHB and used by the ETC. For the Cycle 19 IHB we updated this value to 1.8e-6
counts/s/pixel, which is based on a slightly different analysis technique, and
includes pulse-height filtering. However, ETC 19 continues to use the more
conservative value of 2.25e-6 counts/s/pixel in its calculations, and COS
Acquisitions do not use any pulse-height filtering, so the higher background
rate is appropriate in those cases.
