A Stellar Spectral Flux Library By A.J. Pickles (1998) (PASP 110, 863)
......................................................................

This library of wide spectral coverage consists of 131 flux-calibrated
stellar spectra, encompassing all normal spectral types and luminosity
classes at solar abundance, and metal-weak and metal-rich F-K dwarf
and G-K giant components. Each spectrum in the library is a combination of
several sources overlapping in wavelength coverage. The creator of the
library has followed precise criteria to combine sources and to assemble
the most reliable spectra. As part of the selection criteria prior to
combination, all input sources were checked against the SIMBAD database
and against the colors and line strengths as derived by the observed
spectra themselves to make sure they had similar spectral types.
